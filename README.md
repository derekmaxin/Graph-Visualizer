    ## Setup

    ## Enhancements
    1) Added a colour theme selector for the pie graph. The colour selector is located as the rightmost element on the toolbar.
        Because of the position on the toolbar, the default width of the program was increased slightly to allow it to appear 
        when the program starts. There are three colours: Red, Green, and Blue to choose from. See the pie graph view to see
        the effect.
    2) Added a new statistic to the Bar (STAT) view (Renamed from the Bar (SEM) view). The statistic added was median and
        the value is displayed under the sem value as well as there was a line added to visualize the median on the graph.
        Adittionally, I have colour-coded mean, SEM, and median to more easily distinguish which line represents which stat
        on the graph
